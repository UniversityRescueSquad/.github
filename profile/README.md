## University Rescue Squad

University Rescue Squad is a non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Bulgaria, committed to providing reliable rescue services to those in need. Our dedicated teams of highly trained volunteers specialize in responding to all kinds of natural disasters by providing medical first aid, fighting forest fire, conducting search and rescue operations, doing technical rescue (such as rope rescue), and more. We work closely with the local civil protection authorities and the Bulgarian Red Cross to ensure a coordinated response to emergencies. Our mission is to save lives and protect the communities we serve.
